/**
 The protocol lays down the contract for the class that needs to provide the implementation of the Web Service.
 
 No assumptions are made regarding the semantics or nature of the web service or it's internal implementation.
 The service might be a REST one or SOAP based (it's variants like XML/RPC, Message passing etc.); it might be using cookie
 based session semantics or signing the API requests using OAuth. All these are implementation details and it's upto the
 concrete subclasses to handle these.
 
 The framework provides the abstract implmentation of the protocol with Service class; inheritors can either start providing
 specific implementations based on this class or if one wants to write a class from grounds up, then it needs to implement this protocol.
