 The class provides the abstract implementation of the ServiceProtocol.
 
 Even at this level, the implementation details are abstract - the class makes no assumptions about the semantics of the
 web service.
 
 It just provides the bare minimal starting infrastructure for the concrete implementors & acts as a starting point.
