/**
 The protocol lays down the basic contract for implementing the client functionality.
 'Client' is a generic term & it's generally a facade. The Client facade abstracts the tasks like:
 - Performing Web Service calls, handling the response and returning the domain specific objects to it's consumer.
 - Do the housekeeping operations like - updating the data/metadata locally. Client may or may not use the local DB;
 it depends upon the needs of the specific client.
 - Manage the security aspects of the application
 - Taking care of concurrency or thread pool managment in case it handles the tasks concurrently.
 
 The Client might internally use the helper or other infrastructure compoents like - Service, Security Manager, DB Manager etc.
 to meet it's objective.
 
 The client is constructed by providing it an appropriate ClientConfiguration instance.

     Before making any meaningful API calls to the server (including login), client will need to do a handshake with server.
     By doing handshake, the client will come to know about the API versions supported by the server. The server, in it's response
     also sends the appropriate prefix to be appended for inoking versioned endpoints. The client shall settle down with the API version
     based on following guidelines:
     1. If the client is shipped with the highest API version amongst the list of versions returned by the server, then it shall be used.
     2. If the client is shipped with the most recent API version but server doesn't publish it in it's supported list, then the highest
     version of server shall be used.
     3. If by some mechanism or customer specific deployment scenarios, it happens that the server has most recent API version but client
     is not shipped with it, then client shall use it's highest version.
     4. In short, if we take the intersection of- list of API versions published by server & ones supported by client, from this intersection,
     always use the highest version numbe.
     @serverURL The URL of the server with which the client is supposed to make an API handshake, negotiate and, settle down with an
     approrpriate API version for further web service calls.
     @completionHandler - the completion handler block to execute; can be nil.
