 The abstract subclass of Operation encapsulates the web service request to be performed and the corresponding response to be

 - invocation of a web service operation
 - response receveived as a result of performing web service operation
 The class doesn't assume any semantics of the web service like - whether it's REST endpoint or SOAP message/method call.
 The particular subclass shall handle these semantics & prepare the appropriate request or process the corresponding response.
