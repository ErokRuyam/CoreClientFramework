/**
 An abstract class which helps encpasulate the work to be performed asychronously i.e. on differnet thread.
 Most of the times, it will be used with the NSOperationQueue but it's possible to start it manually - in which case,
 the onus is on the implementor of the subclass to override the -start() method and spawn a new thread or submit it to
 dispatch queue.
 NOTE: In context of the Client framework, the Operation instances are exclusivly used with NSOperationQueue. As such,
 the implementation is non-concurrent (because operation queue takes the responsibility to spawn a thread & execute opeeration's
 main method on that secondary thread.) and both the properties - asynchronous, concurrent have their default values viz. NO.
 
 VRMClient or it's version specific subclass will generally instantiate the Operation instances which are encapsulated/contained
 in the instance of ClientTask.
 
 This class is abstract and as such shall not be instantiated. It only provides a basic implementation of -main() method whereby
 it only checks for the cancelled flag & returns immediately (obviously by performing the necessary cleanup) upon detecting it to be YES.
